# JWTprep

A JSON Webtoken Security project, which will protect your endpoints.
It requires a running MySQL server to handle users (Username/password)

All necessary code is in the package 'security'. Therefore you can simply copy that package into your existing Java Spring application. And then adjust settings as you like.
You MUST change the secret in application.properties
